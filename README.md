This is not a thorough or complete implementation of a framework, but instead a brainstorm of different components that 
can be created. 

Ideally, each of the components - core, api, ui, and db can have their own respective packages or we could start by 
creating a core package with shared api, ui and db functionality. Then any new test project can simply import our shared
package(s).

Please refer to the "Framework ideas.pdf" where I put together some examples of how I have created frameworks in the past.

The requirements.txt contains necessary Python packages.

UI (Selenium) with pytest sample:

1. Access the terminal running your python (virtual) environment
2. Change directory to the ui folder
3. Enter "pytest" into your terminal and press Enter
4. Test for demo site "https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/" will be ran
5. Screenshot will be saved to ui folder

Behave sample:
1. Access the terminal running your python (virtual) environment
2. Change directory to the tests folder
3. Enter "behave" into your terminal and press Enter
4. Output for Behave will be displayed
