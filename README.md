This is not a thorough or complete implementation of a framework, but instead an explanation of the different components that can be created.

Please refer to the "Framework ideas.pdf" where I put together some examples of how I have created frameworks in the past.

The requirements.txt contains necessary Python packages.

UI is further along so after installing necessary packages and you want to run a sample test:

1. Access the console running your python (virtual) environment
2. Change directory to the ui folder - cd /ui
3. Enter "pytest" into your conosle and press Enter
4. Test for demo site "https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/" will be ran
